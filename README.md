# Agentic RAG

This repository contains my code as part of PyLadies AI Agents Study Group.

The code is following the [Introduction to Use Case for Agentic RAG](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit3/agentic-rag/introduction) chapter of the [HuggingFace Agents Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit0/introduction).

I used python 3.12.7 locally

Please make sure you have a [HuggingFace HUB API token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens), and a local `.env` file (otherwise change the code accordingly to load the environment variable)
